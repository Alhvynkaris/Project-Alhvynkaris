The language of [[Magic]|magic], Abstraction, is a difficult and convoluted language that must be learned in order to effectively create your own spells. It is unnecessary to learn if you only copy spells from textbooks.

# What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is the language of concepts. Any and all concepts can be conveyed via Abstraction, and the runes that take in the Abstraction will try to fulfill said concepts. However, runes cannot create concepts that break the laws of physics, or are of a state without describing how said state came to be. E.g., the concept of death. Depending on what exactly you mean, you would likely just Manifest a corpse. It cannot be used to invoke death, as in, cause someone to die, as it alone does not describe how they died.

There are numerous phenomenon with Abstraction that will be covered.

## Concepts
Concepts are what Abstraction truly is. Concepts are defined by what they are defined by the mage to be, with the strong influence of other beliefs on the particular concept. A mage cannot truly control the exact concept, as other's belief will always have some influence. The most practical concept is the concept of math, which is a [[Abstraction#Concept Stability|stable]] concept, and thus can be used with no worries for accidental influence, except in bleeding edge theoretical mathematics not properly defined yet.

## Concept Stability
The more people that believe the definition of a concept is the same as each other, the stronger the influence over the concept becomes, until it is considered a *stable* concept.

## Compound Concepts
Compound concepts occur when 2 or more concepts in Abstraction are conceptually compatible, and thus when both are used, create a compound concept. Compound concepts can be made directly, but it is more frequently discovered by testing what concepts work together to create a compound concept. A compound concept has both of the complete properties of the concepts used to form it.

## Average Concepts
Average concepts occur when 2 or more concepts in Abstraction are somewhat conceptually compatible, and thus when both are used, create an average concept. Average concepts can be made directly, but it is more frequently discovered by testing what concepts work together to create an average concept. An average concept has equal parts of the properties of the concepts used to form it.

## Paradoxical Concepts
A paradoxical concept is any concept that cannot be used by Imperative runes, and are likely describing concepts that are too abstract for physical Manifestation or Alteration. Because they cannot exist normally, they are exclusively used via [[Magic#Intent Magic|intent magic]].
