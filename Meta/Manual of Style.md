> *“Always begin with a related quote, for flair, supplementary to the following texts or not.”*
>Full Capitalized Name and/or Capitalized Title or lowercase job, potentially followed by a supplementary action, and no ending punctuation

---

A short and general description of the following document; what is it and what is it not, in a brief (1-3 sentence) summary. Write in US English. The [Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) plugin should handle some errors, but not all. Write with American English. Follow the punctuation rules stated in *[The Punctuation Guide](https://thepunctuationguide.com)* lest stated otherwise.

## Initial Heading for First Topic
And the information about it. Do not overuse H2; prefer to put multiple topics under the same H2, whether related to themselves or the head. Write with all numbers as numerals, unless it is in a quote. Write akin to the [Wikipedia Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style)‘s initial premise: straightforward,[^1] succinct, in easily understood language.[^2] If a topic is dependent on other documents for understanding and does not include the relevant info in a previous topic on the same document, ***link the supplementary documents*** instead of assuming assumption, directly to its header if possible, preferably a link to the [[Alh Structure Guide|document]] in the sentence.[^3]

> *“Quotes within topics follow the same formatting as the initial flair quote, but it is preferable for it to be more relevant and meaningful.”*
>Full Capitalized Name, even if mentioned in previous paragraphs or in previous quotes

### Names
To change subtopics, use H3 to describe them. You don’t always need to have a topic sentence(s) at the start of an H3

When introducing proper nouns attached to people, write the full name with capitalized titles the first time, then just the first name with no titles, lest for dramatic flair;


>[!NOTE] How to Callout
>Callouts are used to bring attention to things as examples, or as interesting facts to add that are too long for footnotes or too important for trivia. Name the callout related to its topic, and keep it to its original purpose. This callout is as an example of callouts, and to fulfill the example of aforementioned title text.


### Numbers
When typing out numbers, you will type the integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3), rather than the word (e.g., one, two, three,) unless acceptable for demonstration as in when typing numbers for quotes, names, titles, etc, use the word.

### Lists
- End tabs with proper punctuation.
- Indent with tabs.
- Refrain from long unbroken indentation chains.
	- Don’t do this:
		- I will burn.
			- If you do this.
				- Seriously.
					- No.
						- Wait why aren’t you stopping?
							- Hey!
								- Come back here!
									- How dare you.
	- Do do this:
		- Its acceptable.
		- Its not a staircase any more!
			- Some additional information.
		- Ah, such a beautiful list.
			- Truly, isn’t it.
			- Yes, indeed. I am unrelated to the sentence above.
			- Absolutely.
		- Its so beautiful. I love lists.


### Miscellaneous
General stylistic guidance that isn’t large enough for its own H3. H4 does not need its own preface or topic paragraph/sentence, but may be included.

#### Acceptable Abbreviations
 - Misc as in miscellaneous, except in any conlang to English translation wherein you would write out the full *miscellaneous*, lest written in the conlang as a [colexification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colexification) abbreviation.
 - Etc as in et cetera, same clause as misc, but writing out the full *et cetera*.
 - E.g. as in for example, same clause as misc, but writing out the full *for example*.
 - I.e. as in that is, same clause as misc, but writing out the full *that is*.
 - Alh as Alhvynkaris, *only* after possible semantic satiation or if it must be written frequently.
 - Aev as Aevelas, same clause as Alh.
 - Conlang as constructed language.

#### Typing Practices
[Markdown link](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#External+links) words that you may consider to be rarely used (English more archaic than Shakesphere, advanced words only seen in English major classrooms, etc) to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. If the word is more of a term or unavailable on the aforementioned dictionary, link it to the appropriate Wikipedia article like how colexification was linked above. If both the Merriam-Webster dictionary *and* Wikipedia is unavailable, you may not be using a real word. If this unreal word is actually a word in any conlang or an Alhvynkaris specific term, markdown link to its most appropriate document.

The hierarchy of priority from greatest to least for conlang word linking is;
 - Exact word.
 - Phrase the ([fossil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_word#:~:text=A%20fossil%20word%20is%20a,'%20in%20'much%20ado'.)) word is used in.
 - Exact dialect of its conlang.
 - Exact conlang.
 - [[Conlang Index|Conlang index]].

Link to more obscure markdown techniques to their appropriate Obsidian page, like how “[Markdown link](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#External+links),” was done redundantly just above. Links, whether [internal](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#Internal+links) or [external](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#External+links), should not spill over in the parenthesis they may be in. Formatting the links, please remove tracking data, if any, from them, and expunge the `www.` for file size and consistency unless the website has archaic DNS settings and is only accessible with the `www.` subdomain, like so: `www.redundantwebsitename.com`. When in need of a placeholder or example link, link to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) out of courtesy for Obsidian being the foundation of this project. THANK YOU OBSIDIAN!! :heart:[^4]

Feel free to **bold** or *italicize*, when attention and tension is intended to be brought to them. Do not however, overuse it. Use asteriks for both bold and italic by default for out-of-Obsidian legibility, lest underscores are needed for markdown edge cases.

Use em dashes (`—`) , ellipsis’ (`…`) , and curly quotes (`“”`). Em dashes can be typed with a double hyphen (`--`), ellipsis with 3 periods (`…`), and curly quotes are placed automatically.

### Trivia Section
 - If some additional information is short, unnecessary, *and* doesn’t fit into a comment into the text as a footnote, you may put it down in a trivia section, *as a list*. There must be a line break between the trivia section and the section above it.

[^1]: Use the “By 2 Sentences” policy, wherein the point is gotten to or meaninfully started by the second sentence or sooner.
[^2]: Use complicated words to *condense* information, i.e., to get to the point quicker. Do **not** use complicated words to add to your word count. Ensure your reader is capable of searching up the definition of words, so keep to words found in the Merriam-Webster dictionary.
[^3]: Although the temptation of using § and ¶ symbols are inescapable, we must refrain from the lawyer writing lands until we are writing laws for our nations. Review § 1, ¶ 1, footnote 2 as to why that is.
[^4]: You may be more “casual,” when writing footnotes—use them to add additional flair, interesting facts, but, do **not** let the joke make it difficult to actually use the footnote like its intended purpose to add supplementary information.
