This document details the expression and art of magic. It is highly advised to read [[Abstraction]] and [[Mana]] before reading this document. The document assumes a basic understanding of Abstraction and Mana, and will provide general reminders of Abstraction in it.

## Runes
All magic is the usage of *runes*; symbols with special meaning to the universe that influence the universe when given mana. There are 6 categories of runes: Definition, Observation, Argumentation, Manifestation, Alteration, Declaration. The former 3 can be referred to as Definitive runes, and the latter 3 can be referred to as Imperative runes.

There are many runes in the same categories for the sole purpose of optimization, like all other runes. While a mage could technically only use 1 Manifestation rune to Manifest anything, it becomes a critical jack-of-all-trades problem, leading to massive inefficiencies. The same idea applies to all other categories. This is called *runic optimization*.

### Definition Runes
Definition runes store information and can be referred to by other Imperative runes. They are the basis of any spell, being almost always required for safe and predictable casting.[^1] The information they store is exclusively in Abstraction.

Actually *using* Definition runes is the most difficult part of magic. Abstraction may seem simple on the outside—which can be true with simple concepts and simple Manifestations—but total concept magic is extraordinarily difficult to wrap one’s head around. Hence, the popularity of *numbers*. Math is technically a concept covered by Abstraction, but is much more understood and logical than other concepts. By operating with simple concepts along with numbers, Abstraction becomes reasonable once again.

Multiple Definition runes can be used together to get compound, average, or paradoxical concepts—which can yield curious results, such as finding the average concept of fire and ice. Read more on compound, average, and paradoxical concepts, [[Abstraction#Compound Concepts|here]], [[Abstraction#Average Concepts|here]], and [[Abstraction#Paradoxical Concepts|here]] respectively.

Higher Circle Definition runes can store higher quantities and broad-ness of Abstraction, although due to runic optimization, it is better to have each Definition rune in a spell designed to store a specific Abstraction. The more un-alike an Abstraction is to a Definition rune, the more space in the Definition rune it will take up, and the Abstraction *clarity* will fall as well, thus distorting the concept.

The mana cost is of itself at shaping, and of the Abstraction within it.

### Observation Runes
When casting a spell, it can be difficult to change your Definition runes while its being or have been casted. Observation runes solve this issue by Observing things around them, updating themselves as Abstraction of which can be used like a Definition rune by Imperative and Argumentation runes. They have difficulties perfectly Observing concepts; a constraint lifted somewhat by Circle level, but never to the level of a same-Circle Definition rune. They have the same Abstraction phenomena as Definition runes as well.

The mana cost is of itself at shaping, and of Observing the world, thus updating the Abstraction within it. Changes to the Abstraction within it cost mana based on how much of the Abstraction was changed.

### Argumentation Runes
In order to get more advanced, logical behavior, one can utilize Argumentation runes. Effectively, they are logic gates for Abstraction used to process Abstraction for more automatic and context aware usage of Iteration runes. At higher Circles, they become faster at processing Abstraction.

The mana cost is of itself at shaping, and the mana the Abstraction is as the Argumentation rune's processing cost.

### Alteration Runes
Alteration runes change the state of energy, matter, or fields. As an example, it is often used in "anti-gravity" objects, which really just Alter their speed to be 0m/s relative to the ground. They can also affect matter. Alteration runes cannot create or destroy matter, but they can change the state of the matter. Orientation, composition, density, any physical property caused by itself can be changed. Notably, this means you cannot use Alteration runes to change an object's *weight*, in this usage, as weight is determined by its mass (Alteration runes cannot add or destroy mass) and gravity. Luckily, Alteration runes can also affect fields, such as gravity, so its simply a more complex usage. Back to matter, while Alteration runes can alter the chemical composition, quark manipulation is incredibly difficult, and it is impossible to directly Alter fundamental particles into other fundamental particles[^5].

Notably, they struggle with Altering energy, matter, or fields, when instructed more conceptually, akin to how Observation runes struggle with Observing concepts. This limitation decreases per Circle at the same rate of Observation runes, but the Altered result must still remain in the laws of physics.

The mana cost is of itself at shaping, and the direct mana to energy/matter equation (1 aou equals 1 joule/equivalent unit) when activated. For affecting fields, the mana cost is of the amount of energy it would take to normally undo such field (#WIP-Phyiscs).

### Manifestation Runes
While Definitives can comprehend and control concepts as Abstraction, Manifestation runes struggle at Manifesting concepts. They initially can *only* Manifest energy or matter. However, at higher Circles, they become more capable of Manifesting concepts, to a limited degree until it hits the limits of physics.

While it can be told by Definitives to Manifest either water (H~2~O) or the concept of water (as "water itself"), the result of both instructions is practically just water. The chemical instruction would generate only water, but the concept of water would generate water in accordance to the exact concept the Abstraction implies. Perhaps there's the natural impurities in water, maybe even life. The broadness a Manifest concept can be is always limited by Circle; higher Circle allows for a broader concept to be Manifested.

### Declaration Runes
The most powerful rune possible. Takes in raw Abstraction like a Definition rune and Declares the most exact conceptual definition of it into the world. They are exceedingly complex and expensive, breaking from the typical Circle mana cost schema, and are exclusively Thirteenth Circle runes.

## The Measure of a Mage
Mages are split into 13 Circles; effectively, their rank. First through Twelfth Circles are *"normal"*. Thirteenth Circles are called [[Alhvarikos]], the heralds of the [[Alvekai]].

### What is a ‘Circle’?
A Circle is a measurement of a mage’s skill. All runes are sorted into 13 ranked categories, of exponential complexity. If a mage can manifest a Foo-th Circle rune properly, they are considered a Foo-th Circle mage, regardless of their understanding of theory or actual skill beyond mental capacity and capability, as typically, one doesn’t get very far into the Circles without theory. Thus, it is considered a universal method to determine a mage’s power.

Circle was originally based on the occurance of "tiers" to runes, allowing for more abstract and conceptually correct and/or broad Definitives and Imperatives. When it was found that it was simple to put the ranking of a mage aligned to the tier of runes, the Circle system was made.

For easier comprehension, consider the First Circle to be D&D level 0 spells, Second Circle as level 1 spells, and so on, upto the level 12[^6] spells as Thirteenth Circle spells.

The mana cost of a Foo-th Circle is more technically a mana throughput limit. A First Circle rune has a maximum throughput of 100 aou. Any more, and the rune will [[Magic#Overcasting|*overcast*]]. For reference, 1 aou equals 1 joule, and a boxer's punch applies 700-1000J. A First Circle mage typically has around 150-300 aou on them at all times, and so are technically weaker than a boxer.

Luckily, each Circle up doubles the mana throughput, and on average, triples a mage's mana capacity.

| Circle | Max Aou Throughput | Max Aou Capacity |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1st    | 100                | 300              |
| 2nd    | 200                | 900              |
| 3rd    | 400                | 2,700            |
| 4th    | 800                | 8,100            |
| 5th    | 1,600              | 24,300           |
| 6th    | 3,200              | 72,900           |
| 7th    | 6,400              | 218,700          |
| 8th    | 12,800             | 656,100          |
| 9th    | 25,600             | 1,968,300        |
| 10th   | 51,200             | 5,904,900        |
| 11th   | 102,400            | 17,714,700       |
| 12th   | 204,800            | 53,144,100       |
| 13th   | 409,600            | 159,432,300      |

159,432,300J is quite a lot. The balancing factor is actually *getting* all of that mana.

#### Circles Listing
Each Circle has a title with it, as a fancier way to express one’s rank.

| Circle | Title      |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1st    | Vai        |
| 2nd    | Vana       |
| 3rd    | Valua      |
| 4th    | Vanail     |
| 5th    | Kalas      |
| 6th    | Kande      |
| 7th    | Kynavi     |
| 8th    | Kaevik     |
| 9th    | Kavikan    |
| 10th   | Aklan      |
| 11th   | Aivyka     |
| 12th   | Aalharis   |
| 13th   | Alhvarikos |

A Vai can illuminate their surroundings, while an Aalharis can create what is practically a miniature sun, with sufficient[^2] mana. However, the gap between Alhvarikos and Aalharis is incomparable, as divine runes can be declared to be infinitely more powerful, whilst as simple[^3] as a First Circle rune.

The following depicts notes on each the 13 Circles.
#### Vai
A Vai is the very start of a mage. At this stage, a mage is considered weaker than a trained swordsman in combat, although the cantrips the Vai can cast are very beneficial to any lifestyle. Thus, many who can afford it take a year or two to become a Vai, if only for the convenience.

#### Vana
Often considered the ‘cannon fodder’ of mages, where their power is acceptable yet being sufficiently cheap for armies to train en mass.

#### Valua

#### Vanail

#### Kalas

#### Kande

#### Kynaiv

#### Kaevik
Almost all nobles are at least in the 8th Circle, for personal protection and as proof-of-power.

#### Kavikan

#### Aklan

#### Aivyka

#### Aalharis

##### Alhvarikos
Alhvarikos are infamously blessed with the ability to cast thirteenth circle runes, also known as divine runes. In brief overview, such runes are supremely powerful. They break the laws of physics[^4] as their respective [[Alvekai]] declares. However, each Alhvarikos can only use the Declaration runes gifted from their respective Alvekai, so in theory, a new Alhvarikos could only be as powerful as an Aalharis.

Alas, no Alvekai would leave their Aalharis defenseless, so such an instance lasts only for an instant or so.

[^1]: See *[[Magic#Miscast|miscasting]]*.
[^2]: If a Tenth+ Circle mage ever says ‘sufficient’ mana, they actually mean obscene quantities and are just saying sufficient to sound like the intellectual they aren’t.
[^3]: And thus as trivial to cast, by an Alhvarikos.
[^4]: Note that the laws of magic are considered to be within the laws of physics.
[^5]: That doesn't stop you from utilizing Alteration runes to provide the optimal setup for such a thing... although I personally do not know how you would do so. I imagine its possible somehow. Help me, physicists!
[^6]: Yes, I know that 12th level spells are technically unobtainable in normal D&D. Alhvynkaris mages are just built different, although their gods are also much stronger than D&D gods, and so the Mystra's of Alhvynkaris ([[Lunai]] and [[Athelh]]) won't be killed.
